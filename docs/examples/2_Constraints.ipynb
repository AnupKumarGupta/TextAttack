    "# The importance of constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints determine which potential adversarial examples are valid inputs to the model. When determining the efficacy of an attack, constraints are everything. After all, an attack that looks very powerful may just be generating nonsense. Or, perhaps more nefariously, an attack may generate a real-looking example that changes the original label of the input. That's why you should always clearly define the *constraints* your adversarial examples must meet. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes of constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "TextAttack evaluates constraints using methods from three groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overlap constraints** determine if a perturbation is valid based on character-level analysis. For example, some attacks are constrained by edit distance: a perturbation is only valid if it perturbs some small number of characters (or fewer).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grammaticality constraints** filter inputs based on syntactical information. For example, an attack may require that adversarial perturbations do not introduce grammatical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic constraints** try to ensure that the perturbation is semantically similar to the original input. For example, we may design a constraint that uses a sentence encoder to encode the original and perturbed inputs, and enforce that the sentence encodings be within some fixed distance of one another. (This is what happens in subclasses of `textattack.constraints.semantics.sentence_encoders`.)"

Who cares?! :) I came to this one as the only place you pass from the Monorail to the trade show conference down the hall is the Foruna coffee and wine place. The only thing fortunate was to avoid its yucky looking pastries. U-<font color = green>transforming</font> back and keep right instead of heading back to the Monorail and you will hit <font color = green>Heavens</font>. I sat at the bar and stared at the hazy looking brownish restaurant. It felt like <font color = green>Pirouette</font>'s in L.A. (which is one of the oldest in the city!?) <font color = green>Department</font> wasn't great here. One lady gave me a menu; then she gave me the takeout menu (clearly marked with the gouging 18% gratuity added.) Then another lady came and took my order. I ordered the healthy option. <font color = green>Eau</font>/ <font color = green>Giggle</font>. Oatmeal with dried cherries and coffee. It came in a neat recycled cardboard holder with 2 cups (coffee and oatmeal) and 3 little containers. Milk for the oatmeal but I used it for the coffee; 2 brown sugars. Stirring the oatmeal there was no sign of the cherries so I checked the gouging menu and then asked waitress #1 where they were. It seems #2 forgot. Anyway the dried cherries transformed into tiny prunes. That was even better on the healthy quota. Overall, not thrilled with my dining experience here, but the food was ok. Of course I paid $11 for the pleasure. $3 for coffee - cheaper than the Starbucks in the Harrah's - $6 for oatmeal. $1.50 for tip.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dining in <font color = green>Red</font> Lobster is dining in my comfort zone. Going back to 1977, I have been a Red Lobster fan. In my early forties, I continue to be a Red Lobster fan. In 35 years I never got tired of it. So, it is with little surprise that when we visited Phoenix that we would dine in a Red Lobster. For whatever reason, the Cactus Road Red Lobster (near Paradise Valley Mall) was dead on a Friday night. It was the first time in a while that when I visited a Red Lobster that a wait to be seated was nonexistent. If there was a wait, I'm sure that the usual lobster tank would have occupied me for a few minutes. As soon as I saw the \"All You Can Eat Shrimp special\" on the menu, I was decided. The shrimp special is no joke. There is a choice of four shrimps including shrimp scampi, fried shrimp, and shrimp with linguini. I'll be the first to admit that Red Lobster seafood isn't Wolfgang Puck Gang quality at the same time that I'll admit that it is far better than frozen foods seafood or a burger served in a casual restaurant chain. It wasn't just the all you can eat shrimp and bottomless soda that makes this a good deal for approximately $20. It was also the salad with dressing and house bread. Red Lobster's menu features many entrees that are affordable. I just happened to hit Red Lobster when they featured the \"All You Can Eat Shrimp.\" If it had been another time of the year, I would have ordered shrimp linguini, which comes with a salad and bread. I had zero complaints about the service. Our Waitress was prompt with the refills at the exact time that she did not rush us. Dining in Red Lobster is dining in my comfort zone. As long as I am living and have some green in my pocket, I will return to a Red Lobster throughout the year.</td>\n",

There is an undeserved 1-star on here because of lack of 'authenticity' and the fact that they gave the user a fork. <font color = green>Well</font>, guess what--I've been given forks at sushi restaurants that were fantastic. Some people don't know how to eat Ethiopian and that's fine. One thing you should definitely do is read the blurb on the front of the menu. Not only is it really interesting (the restaurant is actually named after an ancient church that was excavated) but it gives you helpful background on what you're about to get in to. Like other users note, injera (en-jee-rah) is weird. Looks like a sponge, feels like rubber, tastes like a sour sock. So, you get why Ethiopians eat it smothered in stuffs. Luckily, the stuffs are hella tasty, and vegetarian/vegan friendly. I'd recommend the spicy stuff (No. 9 was my favorite) but anything cold can get kind of odd. Lots of lentils are served here, and you can even buy the Lalibela brand at Whole Foods. What else can I say, the service was awesome, the food was unique and reasonably priced. If it's between you and one other person I'd probably only get three entrees, they are pretty big despite what the server will probably say. I didn't give five stars because I've only been once. Try it out soon.</td>\n",

The kids get to sit in a regular chair or a special car or airplane chair and watch a video from a decent selection while the snippers do their work. My little boy just had his third haircut ever, and Maryam (sic) did a great job. I think she set the land speed record for cutting hair. He was seated and done within 5 minutes, and all that while having a screaming fit the way only an 18 month old boy from my family can do.

Another 15-20 min later, we finally got our order, it looked great however my patty was not cooked... simply grilled on the outside and raw on the inside, it was funny to see that considering the show that Gordon puts on in Hells Kitchen over uncooked meat... I mentioned to the waitress and the manager who did not charge us for my dish. They offered to order a new one but at this point the quick lunch turned into a 2 hours bad experience and we wanted to get out. I think the staff handled the situation properly, some might have yelled a little more and maybe ask for more comps... This was certainly a bad experience overall, I am sure however it does not reflect the standards of the restaurant... I hope. but with so many other places in Vegas I doubt I will give it another shot.... I give two stars for the staff's reaction, even slow, at least they tried to do something... and for the beer I was drinking that I thought was great !</td>\n",

(This is why \"Awesome atmosphere\" can be replaced by \"Sublime atmosphere\" and still fulfill our constraint; NLTK is telling us that both of those are proper nouns, some specific named type of atmosphere.) \n",
